## ðŸ›  Dependencies

* ROS Noetic or Melodic
* Gazebo 9+
* `apriltag_ros`
* `rosdep`

## Setting up the Project

* Create a ROS workspace

```bash
mkdir catkin_ws
cd catkin_ws
```

* Inside the workspcace, clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:theshauryajha/quadrotor_simulation.git
```

* Make the setup script executable and run it
```bash
cd quarotor_simulation
chmod +x setup_simulation.sh
./setup_simulation.sh
```

* Source the workspace
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
```

## Launching the simulation

* Run the main launch file

```bash
roslaunch quadrotor_control simulation.launch
```

* The simulation can also be launched with custom spawn parameters from the platform

```bash
roslaunch quadrotor_control simulation.launch x:=2.0 y:=3.5 yaw:=1.57
```

* This spawns the platform at (2.0, 3.5) and rotated in the xy plane by 90 degrees

## ðŸš§ Ongoing Work

The project is currently being extended to support remote control of the landing platform. Additionally, the mission planner is being modified to enable successful drone landings on a *moving* platform, adding dynamic interaction capabilities to the system.
